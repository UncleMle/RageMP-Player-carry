# RageMP-Player-carry
This script allows you to carry player with the use of raycasting. 

Whole system is synced between clients. Any player can go up to a player and press E to carry them. This can be combined with an injury system to be able to carry only injured players can be done with a simple check for a shared injured variable. 

The player can then press X to drop the player. 

If you want the target player to have a custom name in the script you can assign the .nickName property a value this can be combined with a alias system. 

To use this resource place the client file into client_packages and set it as a requirement in your index.js file. To install the server side file you can create a new file called 'PlayerCarry' and set it inside of an index.js file to have the package auto loaded.
