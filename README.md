# RageMP-Player-carry
This script allows you to carry player with the use of raycasting. 

All animations are synced the player can go up to a player that is injured then press E on them to carry. 

The player can then press X to drop the player. 

As can be seen in the script there is instances of me using a custom notification event to update the player. You can implement this yourself or simply push the messages to chat with the method mp.gui.chat.push('message').
